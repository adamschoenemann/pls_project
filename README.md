# Verified Finger Trees al√° Hinzer and Paterson
This repository is a project that I and Oscar Toro did for the Programming Languages Seminar
course at ITU.

It is an implementation and verification of the Finger Tree data-structure, first popularized
by Hinze and Paterson. There is a report in this repo with references and explanation.

The verification was actually quite challenging due to polymorphic recursion! But also
a very fun learning experience.
